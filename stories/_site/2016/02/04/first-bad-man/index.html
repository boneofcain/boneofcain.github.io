				<p>The first man I dated seriously had a totally mundane, normal man name – like Andrew, or Daniel, or Eric. But, I’m going to call him what he was: <em>the first very bad man</em>, or Vbm1 for short.</p>

<p>It was May. I had just turned 18, and I was a few weeks away from graduating high school. The coffee shop I worked at had just gone out of business, and I was desperate for a job. I looked in the local newspaper classifieds and ended up landing a terrible telemarketing gig selling magazines over the phone in some squat, run-down building with moldy carpet and stained ceiling tiles. It was attached to the shittiest gas station in town.</p>

<p>My first day on the phones, my manager sat me down between two young men. The one on my right, Brett (<em>with two Ts</em> he always announced when introducing himself), was rail thin, had rotting teeth, and had the longest, knobbiest fingers I’d ever seen. His entire <em>being</em> smacked of white trash con artist. Not to spoil the story, but I wasn’t wrong about him at all.</p>

<p>The young man on my left was Vbm1. He was healthier-looking than Brett, and was reclined in his chair, swiveling from side to side. His demeanor was totally effortless and aside from the holey, bleach-stained tshirt he was wearing, he was actually kinda cute. When I sat down, Vbm1 stopped swiveling and straightened up in his chair.</p>

<p>I was busy trying to connect my headset to the computer when I noticed Vbm1 hunched over his desk out of the corner of my eye. I looked toward him, and saw him scribbling something on a piece of paper.
He looked up, made eye contact with me, and slowly slid the piece of paper toward me. I broke eye contact to look at the paper. It said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;——— sex machine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My eyes followed the scrawled arrow back to Vbm1. He had an almost predatory grin drawn across his face.</p>

<p>I don’t remember how I felt in that moment, but I remember what I did. I grabbed my pen and wrote a return note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;——— <strike>sex</strike> machine GUN ———&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I put the note back on his desk. He followed my arrow back to me. He still had the same stupid fucking grin on his face.</p>

<p>And that’s how I met Vbm1. And that’s how what I call the “Longest Lost Year” began.</p>
