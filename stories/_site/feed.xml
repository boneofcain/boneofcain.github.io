        <title>how i met the first very bad man.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first man I dated *seriously* had a totally mundane, normal man name -- like Andrew, or Daniel, or Eric. But, I&#39;m going to call him what he was: the first very bad man, or vbm1 for short. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It May. I had just turned 18, and I was a few weeks away from graduating high school. The coffee shop I worked at had just gone out of business, and I was desperate for a job. I looked in the local newspaper classifieds and ended up landing some terrible telemarketing gig, selling magazines over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>first.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
I wasn&#39;t actually whittled from the bone of cain. My stepmom used to tell me that I hatched from a rotten egg, fully-grown and surly.
Before that, I assumed that I sprang from a hole in the ground, like the Celts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I got ahold of a book about biology and learned how human babies are made. I still held onto the idea that I wasn&#39;t human, and was sure the book didn&#39;t apply to my own origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually found out I was actually born of a human woman. By C-section, and I nearly killed her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This realization was the first disappointment I suffered as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
