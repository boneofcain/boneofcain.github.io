<p>The first man I dated *seriously* had a totally mundane, normal man name -- like Andrew, or Daniel, or Eric. But, I'm going to call him what he was: the first very bad man, or vbm1 for short. </p>

<p>It May. I had just turned 18, and I was a few weeks away from graduating high school. The coffee shop I worked at had just gone out of business, and I was desperate for a job. I looked in the local newspaper classifieds and ended up landing some terrible telemarketing gig, selling magazines over the phone.</p>
