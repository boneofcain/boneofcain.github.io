I'd had a bad week. I couldn't shake my dour attitude, and I hadn't showered or changed clothes in 8 days. The only thing I'd been looking forward to was a sock knitting class at 1:00 pm on Saturday that I had signed up for a month earlier. As the week dragged by without motivation to clean or feed myself, I desperately hoped that an obligation to the knitting class would shake me out of my funk.

I grew more excited about the class as I inched toward Saturday -- the idea of doing something quaint and practical like sock knitting was such a bizarrely pure notion that it ignited something strange in me. It evoked the same feelings that the Lehman's Catalog or making my own butter did -- I was some sort of pioneer woman. Like an urban Laura Ingalls Wilder or something. The class promised to be a hard stop for my shitty week -- I'd _have_ to shower, put on something other than a sweatsuit, and actually _go_ somewhere.

Friday night I texted a friend:

> okay, I _promise_ I'm going to take a shower and put on real clothes tomorrow morning. I've been looking forward to this class.

She texted back words of support. I was excited.

I woke up Saturday morning and took a shower. I put on clean clothes and brushed my hair. I had to go get cash to pay for the class, so I stopped by an ATM. Since I was up and out so early, I decided to swing by my shooting range for some firing drills. I finished shooting within 20 minutes, and the staff commented on how quickly I was in and out. I gushed "oh, I'm going to a sock knitting class today! Can't be late."

By 11:45 I was on my way. The class about an hour from the city, so I left myself extra time to get there. Traffic was a tad slow, but I arrived at the knitting store at 12:45 -- 15 minutes to spare.

The staff was chatting quietly in a corner when I came through the door. I walked toward the counter, and one of the ladies asked me if I was checking in for class. I excitedly nodded to affirm, and gave her my name. She moved toward the counter and began flipping through a binder of handwritten pages. She couldn't find my name. Without looking up, she asked "are you here for the felted purse class?" I shook my head and then blurted out "socks" when I realized she hadn't seen me.

She flipped a page in the binder, and pointed to some big blue characters on the page. They were so big I could read them upside down: _10:15_.  The lady looked up at me with an expression that was somewhere between pity and embarrassment -- "_Oh honey_, that class was at 10:15 this morning"

My excitement immediately fell and my spirit lost all buoyancy. "But the website says 1:00 pm" I stammered, hoping that there was some mistake.
She shook her head, and looked back down at the binder. "Did you want to sign up for a future class?" She asked, her whole voice pitching upward at the end.

I shook my head no and went for the door. Involuntarily, I muttered "fuck" as the door closed behind me.

 The salvageability of my week had been riding on this stupid fucking knitting class, and now all of my excitement was for naught. Now I was faced with the hour-long drive home and the feeling of having something I needed badly taken from me. I checked the knitting store's website to make sure I hadn't been mistaken about the class time. There it was: "My First Socks: 1:00 pm". Knowing that it wasn't my fault didn't make me feel any better. It just made me feel like the universe was having a laugh at my expense.

 I pulled my car onto the road and burst into tears and sobs so violent I had to pull over. Knitting socks was supposed to be salvation for my mood. I cried harder when I had a flash of realization that I was having a meltdown over a sock knitting class. After a few minutes, my emotions resolved on their own. I hadn't cried in a long time. I hadn't been pouty about anything in a long time.

 I guess I just wanted something to be sullen over. Traffic was bad and it took nearly two hours to get home.
