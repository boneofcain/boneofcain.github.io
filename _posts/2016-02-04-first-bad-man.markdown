The first man I dated seriously had a totally mundane, normal man name -- like Andrew, or Daniel, or Eric. But, I'm going to call him what he was: *the first very bad man*, or Vbm1 for short.

It was May. I had just turned 18, and I was a few weeks away from graduating high school. The coffee shop I worked at had just gone out of business, and I was desperate for a job. I looked in the local newspaper classifieds and ended up landing a terrible telemarketing gig selling magazines over the phone in some squat, run-down building with moldy carpet and stained ceiling tiles. It was attached to the shittiest gas station in town.

My first day on the phones, my manager sat me down between two young men. The one on my right, Brett (*with two Ts* he always announced when introducing himself), was rail thin, had rotting teeth, and had the longest, knobbiest fingers I'd ever seen. His entire *being* smacked of white trash con artist. Not to spoil the story, but I wasn't wrong about him at all.

The young man on my left was Vbm1. He was healthier-looking than Brett, and was reclined in his chair, swiveling from side to side. His demeanor was totally effortless and aside from the holey, bleach-stained tshirt he was wearing, he was actually kinda cute. When I sat down, Vbm1 stopped swiveling and straightened up in his chair.

I was busy trying to connect my headset to the computer when I noticed Vbm1 hunched over his desk out of the corner of my eye. I looked toward him, and saw him scribbling something on a piece of paper.
He looked up, made eye contact with me, and slowly slid the piece of paper toward me. I broke eye contact to look at the paper. It said:

> <--------- sex machine

My eyes followed the scrawled arrow back to Vbm1. He had an almost predatory grin drawn across his face.

I don't remember how I felt in that moment, but I remember what I did. I grabbed my pen and wrote a return note:

> <--------- <strike>sex</strike> machine GUN --------->

I put the note back on his desk. He followed my arrow back to me. He still had the same stupid fucking grin on his face.

And that's how I met Vbm1. And that's how what I call the "Longest Lost Year" began.
