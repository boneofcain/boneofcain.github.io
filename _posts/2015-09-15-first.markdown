I wasn't actually whittled from the bone of cain. My stepmom used to tell me that I hatched from a rotten egg, fully-grown and surly.
Before that, I assumed that I sprang from a hole in the ground, like the Celts.
</p>
<p>Eventually, I got ahold of a book about biology and learned how human babies are made. I still held onto the idea that I wasn't human, and was sure the book didn't apply to my own origin.</p>

<p>I eventually found out I was actually born of a human woman. By C-section, and I nearly killed her.</p>

<p>This realization was the first disappointment I suffered as a child.</p>
