				<p>I’d had a bad week. I couldn’t shake my dour attitude, and I hadn’t showered or changed clothes in 8 days. The only thing I’d been looking forward to was a sock knitting class at 1:00 pm on Saturday that I had signed up for a month earlier. As the week dragged by without motivation to clean or feed myself, I desperately hoped that an obligation to the knitting class would shake me out of my funk.</p>

<p>I grew more excited about the class as I inched toward Saturday – the idea of doing something quaint and practical like sock knitting was such a bizarrely pure notion that it ignited something strange in me. It evoked the same feelings that the Lehman’s Catalog or making my own butter did – I was some sort of pioneer woman. Like an urban Laura Ingalls Wilder or something. The class promised to be a hard stop for my shitty week – I’d <em>have</em> to shower, put on something other than a sweatsuit, and actually <em>go</em> somewhere.</p>

<p>Friday night I texted a friend:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>okay, I <em>promise</em> I’m going to take a shower and put on real clothes tomorrow morning. I’ve been looking forward to this class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She texted back words of support. I was excited.</p>

<p>I woke up Saturday morning and took a shower. I put on clean clothes and brushed my hair. I had to go get cash to pay for the class, so I stopped by an ATM. Since I was up and out so early, I decided to swing by my shooting range for some firing drills. I finished shooting within 20 minutes, and the staff commented on how quickly I was in and out. I gushed “oh, I’m going to a sock knitting class today! Can’t be late.”</p>

<p>By 11:45 I was on my way. The class about an hour from the city, so I left myself extra time to get there. Traffic was a tad slow, but I arrived at the knitting store at 12:45 – 15 minutes to spare.</p>

<p>The staff was chatting quietly in a corner when I came through the door. I walked toward the counter, and one of the ladies asked me if I was checking in for class. I excitedly nodded to affirm, and gave her my name. She moved toward the counter and began flipping through a binder of handwritten pages. She couldn’t find my name. Without looking up, she asked “are you here for the felted purse class?” I shook my head and then blurted out “socks” when I realized she hadn’t seen me.</p>

<p>She flipped a page in the binder, and pointed to some big blue characters on the page. They were so big I could read them upside down: <em>10:15</em>.  The lady looked up at me with an expression that was somewhere between pity and embarrassment – “<em>Oh honey</em>, that class was at 10:15 this morning”</p>

<p>My excitement immediately fell and my spirit lost all buoyancy. “But the website says 1:00 pm” I stammered, hoping that there was some mistake.
She shook her head, and looked back down at the binder. “Did you want to sign up for a future class?” She asked, her whole voice pitching upward at the end.</p>

<p>I shook my head no and went for the door. Involuntarily, I muttered “fuck” as the door closed behind me.</p>

<p>The salvageability of my week had been riding on this stupid fucking knitting class, and now all of my excitement was for naught. Now I was faced with the hour-long drive home and the feeling of having something I needed badly taken from me. I checked the knitting store’s website to make sure I hadn’t been mistaken about the class time. There it was: “My First Socks: 1:00 pm”. Knowing that it wasn’t my fault didn’t make me feel any better. It just made me feel like the universe was having a laugh at my expense.</p>

<p>I pulled my car onto the road and burst into tears and sobs so violent I had to pull over. Knitting socks was supposed to be salvation for my mood. I cried harder when I had a flash of realization that I was having a meltdown over a sock knitting class. After a few minutes, my emotions resolved on their own. I hadn’t cried in a long time. I hadn’t been pouty about anything in a long time.</p>

<p>I guess I just wanted something to be sullen over. Traffic was bad and it took nearly two hours to get home.</p>
